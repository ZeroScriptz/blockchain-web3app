# Introduction
This project was created to send Ethereum transactions from a Metamask wallet to another person with a tag using text and/or Giphy's. The transactions are done on the Goerli test network, making it easy to test transactions before deploying them on the main Ethereum network.

# Technologies used
ABI (Application Binary Interface) to encode and decode transactions
Solidity for coding the transactions
Goerli test network for testing transactions
Alchemy to bind the Goerli network with the Metamask connection
Tailwindcss for seamless design abilities
Giphy API to render Giphy images for transactions
React for creating reusable components
Working with ABI
ABI (Application Binary Interface) is used to encode and decode transactions in Ethereum. In this project, ABI is used to encode transactions that are sent from the Metamask wallet to another person. The ABI provides a way to describe the structure of the data that is being sent in the transaction, making it easier to parse and understand.

# Solidity transactions and testing on Goerli
In this project, transactions are coded using Solidity. The transactions are tested on the Goerli test network, which is a test network for Ethereum that allows developers to test their applications without risking real funds. The Goerli network is bound to the Metamask connection through Alchemy, making it easy to send transactions from the Metamask wallet.

# Tailwindcss for design
Tailwindcss is a CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed components that can be easily used to create a seamless design for the application. In this project, Tailwindcss is used to style the user interface, providing a clean and modern look for the application.

# Giphy API
The Giphy API is used to render Giphy images for the transactions. This adds a fun and playful aspect to the transactions, making the experience more enjoyable for the user.

# React components
React was used to create multiple reusable components for the application. The transactions were divided into multiple components, including sending transactions, connecting the wallet, checking if the wallet is connected, and getting all transactions. This made it easy to manage and maintain the code, as well as reuse components in other parts of the application.

#Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of various technologies to create an Ethereum transaction application that is easy to use and enjoyable for the user. The use of ABI, Solidity, Goerli, Alchemy, Tailwindcss, Giphy API, and React make it a well-rounded and complete project that can be used as a reference for future Ethereum development projects.
